This is tech blog repository of Dasol Kim.

The front-end and back-end were firstly imported from one of the well-known github blog templates called 'Clean Blog'.
(https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog-jekyll/)

 And I have personally adjusted blog structures so I can properly display who I am as a developer.

The front-end has been built based on the basic fron languages such as HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT with bootstrap injected(most of the elements on the front-end take bootstrap class tags), and also includes Jekyll which is the standard and signature one of what the most people use to build a github blog.

My blog contains those contents below :
- One page of my short resume
- (Mostly) Posts about technoology, specifically, computer science
- International languages - English, Spanish (You can take a look at my resume to figure out why and how a korean developer speaks 'Spanish')
- My thoughts
