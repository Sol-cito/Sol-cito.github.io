Blogging is an effective way for developers to improve their skills and to build up their careers.

Well-designed blog contains footsteps of developersâ€™ thoughts, logic and decent source codes. Programmers are generally very open to share and correct their ideas and solutions among others and to discuss about technological issues like algorithm solutions, learning a new lanuage, solving error messages and so on. So the blog functions as a virtual common space in which tech geeks gather up and share their ideas, and it eventually ends up creating additional values.

Blogging also helps them out to pave their career path. A blog that contains useful and informative contents can be a proper resume to the recruiters in that they can peek at where the blog owner is directed to and what he/she has been trying to achieve.

So I, as a junior developer, came to open my own blog on this cool platform not only to share my ideas and thoughts, but also expand the possibility of my career building.

This blog contents will consist of most of the outcomes from my studies and other stuffs I do.



**Mainly :**

**1. Programming**

**2. English**

**3. Spanish**

**4. ETC(Diary, Essay, book review..)**
